Yelp Dataset Challenge - application for business owners to find where in a city they would be most successful

This project uses Angular.js and D3.js to create a heatmap for small business owners.  The heatmap will be based on businesses with similar attributes (Wi-fi, good for kids, etc.) and similar keywords (coffee, upscale, etc.) to find where in the city it would be most successful.
